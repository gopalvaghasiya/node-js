No.

They don't stare. They don't ogle.

They are a lot more sophisticated than that.

They notice. They observe.

They have a wide angle lens in their eyes and while appearing to look straight they can notice boys out of the corner of their eyes.

At least this is what my wife and all old grannies used to do when they were young and pretty.

In arranged marriages in India, about two generations ago the boy was allowed to look directly at his prospective bride but the girls would look demurely at the floor and take a sneak peak at an opportune moment without any one getting wise to it.

But these days the girls are â€œbindaas".

They look uninhibitedly.

If they are wearing goggles and there is a handsome boy around, you can be sure the girl is looking at him even if she appears to be looking elsewhere.
